# redo-c

redo-c is an implementation of the redo build system (designed by
Daniel J. Bernstein) in portable C with zero external dependencies.

This redo-c is adapted to my (leg/jorge-leon) preferences:
- redo captures stdout of do files in the target file.  Use `redo -S` to
  revert to the original redo-c behavior.
- redo.do is modified for compilation with dietlibc.
- add clean/install/uninstall target


## Documentation

Please refer to the documentation for
[redo in Python](https://github.com/apenwarr/redo/blob/master/README.md),
or the [tutorial by Jonathan de Boyne Pollard](http://jdebp.info/FGA/introduction-to-redo.html)
for usage instructions.

## Notes about the redo-c implementation of redo

* Without arguments, `redo` behaves like `redo all`.

* `.do` files always are executed in their directory, arguments are
  relative paths.

* Standard output of `.do` files is captured as build product unless
  `redo -S` is used, or the environment variable `REDO_STDOUT` is set to 0.

* Non-executable `.do` files are run with `/bin/sh -e`.
  `redo -x` can be utilized to use `/bin/sh -e -x` instead, for
  debugging `.do` files or verbose builds.

* Executable `.do` files are simply executed, and should have a shebang line.

* When a target makes no output, no target file is created.  The target
  is considered always out of date.

* `default.do` files are checked in all parent directories up to `/`.

* Parallel builds can be started with `redo -j N` (or `JOBS=N redo`),
  this uses a job broker similar to but not compatible with GNU make.

* To detect whether a file has changed, we first compare `ctime` and
  in case it differs, a SHA2 hash of the contents.

* Dependencies are tracked in `.dep.BASENAME` files all over the tree.
  This is an implementation detail.

* Builds can be started from every directory and should yield same results.

* `redo -f` will consider all targets outdated and force a rebuild.

* `redo -k` will keep going if a target failed to build.
